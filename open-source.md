- fourTheorem are big proponents of **open-source,** and active supporters of the **broader OSS community.**

- Checkout a new page on our website that highlights the open-source projects to which our developers currently contribute:
[Open Source Projects](https://www.fourtheorem.com/open-source)

This list is embryonic, and will expand over time. We encourage our clients to consider open-source when architecting their **application environments.** Why recreate the wheel when a skilled and vibrant community has created the hub, spokes, and rim already?
